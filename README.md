## About The Analysis
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model. Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
